<p style="text-align:justify;">Volleyball Lineup Tracker (VBLT for short) is a handy utility for volleyball coaches to use before and during matches. Create and manage multiple rosters and lineups including scheduled substitutions and optional libero(s). Track possession, score, time-outs, substitutions, libero swaps, and rotations during a set. Includes support for rally or sideout scoring, side switches, and non-standard start/end scores. Replaces and far exceeds the functionality of a plastic rotation locator costing $8-10...it even reminds you when you have scheduled substitutions.  VBLT is such an easy to use and powerful tool, you'll wonder how you ever coached without it!

Made <b><i>by</i></b>  Volleyball coaches <b><i>for</i></b>  Volleyball coaches, we use it ourselves for every match.  Join us and the thousands of coaches around the world that are using VBLT to simplify their lineup/rotation/sub tracking so they can focus on coaching. Here is an example of the type of feedback we receive after coaches use VBLT for a few weeks:
<br/>
<br/>
<i>"Used the app for about 6 matches now and I love it.  Thank you for this as it is exactly what I have been needing.  A feature that I didn't really notice right away and have come to love is the 'undo' screen.  A great tool when you have to prove where the score keeper made a mistake!"</i> - Coach Scott
